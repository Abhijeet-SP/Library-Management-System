🟢 BEGINNER TASKS (Core SQL & Data Modeling)
Task 0 – Database Initialization
 Create and initialize the library database and switch the active context for all operations.
Task 1 – Branch Table Design
 Create the branch table to store branch-level details including branch ID, manager reference, address, and contact information.
Task 2 – Employee Table Design
 Create the employees table with employee details and link each employee to a branch using a foreign key to enforce referential integrity.
Task 3 – Member Table Design
 Create the members table to track registered library members along with their registration dates.
Task 4 – Audit-Safe Member ID Handling
 Intentionally maintain gaps in member IDs to simulate churn and ensure non-reusable identifiers for audit safety.
Task 5 – Book Inventory Table Design
 Create the books table using ISBN as a globally unique identifier and store book metadata including category, author, and rental price.
Task 6 – Resolve Column Ambiguity
 Rename the status column to inventory_status to clearly represent inventory availability.
Task 7 – Issue Transaction Table
 Create the issued_status table to record book issuance events, linking members, employees, and books via foreign keys.
Task 8 – Return Transaction Table
 Create the return_status table to capture book return events linked to issued records.
Task 9 – Seed Data Insertion
 Insert realistic seed data into all tables to simulate operational library data.
Task 10 – Schema Validation
 Validate table creation and relationships using SELECT queries.




🟡 INTERMEDIATE TASKS (CRUD & Business Analytics)
Task 11 – CRUD Operations
 Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations across core entities.
Task 12 – Controlled Updates with Safety Checks
 Override SQL safety updates only when using primary keys for controlled data modification.
Task 13 – Fix Partial Return Data
 Use JOIN-based UPDATE statements to populate missing return book names and ISBNs.
Task 14 – Multi-Issue Member Detection
 Identify members who have issued more than one book using GROUP BY and HAVING.
Task 15 – Book Issue Frequency Analysis (CTAS)
 Create a derived table using CTAS to store book-wise issue counts.
Task 16 – Category-Based Retrieval
 Retrieve books using single-category, multi-category, and IN-based filters.
Task 17 – Category Revenue Analysis
 Calculate total rental revenue per category using aggregation.
Task 18 – Recent Member Identification
 Identify members registered within a defined time window using date arithmetic.
Task 19 – Employee–Manager Mapping
 List employees along with their branch managers and branch details using self-joins.
Task 20 – High-Value Inventory Identification (CTAS)
 Create a table of expensive books based on rental price thresholds.
Task 21 – Unreturned Book Detection
 Identify books that have been issued but not yet returned using LEFT JOIN and NULL checks.

Task 23 – Overdue Duration Calculation
 Compute the number of overdue days for each unreturned book.
Task 24 – Active vs Inactive Member Classification (CTAS)
 Classify members based on their most recent activity and generate a derived member status table.
Task 25 – Employee Productivity Ranking
 Rank employees based on the number of books issued using aggregation and sorting.
Task 26 – Dynamic Book Availability Logic
 Determine real-time book availability using issued and return records with NULL handling.

 Apply window functions to analyze repeated issuances by members and books.
Task 30 – Stored Procedure Design (Planned)
 Design a stored procedure to update book availability automatically on issue and return events.
Task 31 – Overdue Fine Calculation (CTAS)
 Create a CTAS table calculating overdue fines using per-day penalty logic.
Task 32 – Data Quality & Edge Case Handling
 Address incomplete data, missing IDs, and mismatched records without corrupting history.
Task 33 – System Validation & Reset
 Drop and recreate the database to validate repeatability and schema consistency.
