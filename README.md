# Library-Management-System
Library Management System built using MySQL, modeling real-world library operations with normalized tables, referential integrity, and audit-safe data design. Implements CRUD operations, CTAS, joins, window functions, and date-based analytics for overdue tracking, member activity, and branch performance reporting.

## Objectives

1. **Set up the Library Management System Database**: Create and populate the database with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
3. **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**: Utilize CTAS to create new tables based on query results.
4. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Develop complex queries to analyze and retrieve specific data.
